# üó≥Ô∏è Indian General Election Analysis Using SQL  

## üìå Project Description  
This guided project performs an in-depth analysis of the **Indian General Elections 2024** using SQL. By working with election datasets (states, constituencies, candidates, and results), the project answers important analytical questions such as total seats, party alliances, candidate performance, and voting trends (EVM vs postal).  

The project is based on a guided tutorial from [Data Tutorials YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymHc66aSOUU&list=PLO9LeSU_vHCWpfLDRTT5nBz9Z0libOs5k&index=25).
